SLOTS

HOW TO PLAY SLOTS
Slots is a simple game where the player pays to set the reels spinning.  If the reels land with certain icons arranged behind the 'pay line', the player wins.

Insert Coins
To insert coins, click on the coin slot on the right of the face plate.  You will see the coins dropping into the slot, and the payoff area will highlight to show how much you can win with your present bet.  When you have inserted as many coins as you wish to play, start the reels spinning by either clicking on the 'arm' to pull it, or clicking on the 'spin reels' button.

Winning
When the reels stop, some icons may be showing behind the 'pay line' (a line or lines superimposed on top of the reels to show where winning combinations of icons will land.)  If the icon(s) shown behind the pay line match a winning combination as indicated on the payoff schedule at the top of the machine, you win!

Credits
When you have won, you will not be paid immediately.  Your winnings will accumulate in the slot machine as credits.  To play these credits, click on the Bet One Credit button, or the Bet Max Credits button.  These buttons will transfer money from your credits to your bet, and will allow you to start the reels spinning without having to insert more coins into the slot.

Cash Out
When you wish to take the money out of Credits, and put it into your bank, you can click on Cash Out, which will take your money out of the machine.  To interupt the cashing out animation, click inside the cash out tray while the coins are falling.  This will automatically move all accumulated credits to your bank.
