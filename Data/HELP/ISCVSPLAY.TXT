HOW TO PLAY VIDEO SLOTS
Video Slots is a game where the player pays to set the reels spinning.  If the reels land with certain icons arranged behind the 'pay line', the player wins.

There are 5 reels consisting of three icons each.

There are 9 different "pay lines" available. The player can bet up to 5 coins per pay line. This means that the player can bet as little as 1 coin for 1 pay line (1 line) or 5 coins for 9 pay lines (45 coins), or any combination thereof.


Insert Coins
To insert coins, click on the coin slot on the right of the face plate.  You will see the coins dropping into the slot.  When you have inserted as many coins as you wish to play, start the reels spinning by clicking on the 'spin' button.

Winning
When the reels stop, some icons may be showing behind the 'pay line' (a line or lines superimposed on top of the reels to show where winning combinations of icons will land.)  If the icon(s) shown behind the pay line match a winning combination as indicated on the payoff schedule, you win!  Note that the pay lines can be toggled so that they do not display.

Credits
When you have won, you will not be paid immediately.  Your winnings will accumulate in the video slot machine as credits.  

Cash Out
When you wish to take the money out of Credits, and put it into your bank, you can click on Cash Out, which will take your money out of the machine.  To interupt the cashing out animation, click inside the cash out tray while the coins are falling.  This will automatically move all accumulated credits to your bank.
