HOW TO PLAY RED DOG
The game of Red Dog is played by dealing two cards face up and then a third card is drawn and placed face up between the first two cards.  Players win when the value of the third card drawn is between the values of the first and second card.  The values of the cards are as follows:  Any card from 2 to 10 has its face value.  Any jack has a value of 11.  Any queen has a value of 12.  Any king has a value of 13.  Any ace has a value of 14.

HOW TO PLACE A BET 
To place a bet, click on the chip icon(s) representing the amount you want to bet.  As you click on chips, the number to the right of the instruction line will increase, showing you the amount you currently hold in your 'hand'.  To place the wager on the table, click on the 'Done' button.  To remove chips from your hand, click on the 'Clear' button.

GAME PLAY
After all players have placed their bets, the dealer will deal two cards from the deck.  The two face-up cards will be evaluated, and a marker will be placed on the table to show the spread.  If the cards are consecutive or even, the game is considered to be a tie, and no raises are allowed.  For all other spreads, you will be allowed to place an additional bet of your original bet.  When all additional bets have been placed, the dealer deals one more card.  If this card falls between the first and second in value, the hand is considered to be a winner.  If the original spread is a pair, and the third card is the same value as the first two, winners will be paid 11 to 1.
