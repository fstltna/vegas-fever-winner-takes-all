LET IT RIDE

HOW TO PLAY LET IT RIDE
Let it ride is an exciting and easy to learn casino game, where you try to get the most out of your wager by knowing when to remove up to two of three bets placed, or 'let it ride.'

HOW TO PLACE A BET
To place a bet, click on the chip icon(s) representing the amount you want to bet.  As you click on chips, the number to the right of the instruction line will increase, showing you the amount you currently hold in your 'hand'.  To place the wager on the table, click on the 'Done' button.  To remove chips from your hand, click on the 'Clear' button.  When you place your bet, you will be putting the amount in your hand on the table three times.

THE BASIC GAME
Each player and the dealer receives three cards face down.  You will be shown the three cards that you have been dealt, and asked if you wish to remove a bet or leave it.  If you choose to remove a bet, one of the three wagers you placed will be returned to you.  The dealer will then burn it's bottom card, and reveal one card.  You will be asked again if you wish to remove a bet or leave it.  After all players have made their choice, the dealer will reveal it's final card.  Your three cards plus the dealer's two cards will make up a five card poker hand on which you will be paid according to the number of wagers you have left on the table.
